I am a principal researcher at [NEC Corporation](https://www.nec.com/). I am now
the principal investigator of *Knowledge-Based Learning* research team of [Data
Science Research Laboratories](https://www.nec.com/en/global/rd/) at NEC
Corporation. I received my Ph.D. at [University of
Tsukuba](https://www.tsukuba.ac.jp/en/) in March 2018 under supervision of
[Prof. Hiroyuki Kitagawa](http://www.kde.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp/~kitagawa/index.html).

My research interests are on helping data analysis using <i class="fas
fa-database"></i> data management technologies (DB) and <i class="fas
fa-brain"></i> machine learning technologies (ML).
