I am a computer scientist based in Tokyo, Japan. Currently, I am managing a
research group on **natural language processing** 📚, **data engineering** 🗄️,
and **acoustics** 🗣️ research field at NEC Corporation as the Group Director 🧑‍💼
and a Senior Principal Researcher 🧑‍🔬. I received my Ph.D. at [University of
Tsukuba](https://www.tsukuba.ac.jp/en/) in March 2018 under supervision of
[Prof. Hiroyuki Kitagawa](http://www.kde.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp/~kitagawa/index.html).

My research interests are on **how people can unleash their full potential**
using the power of **machines** 🤖 and **knowledges** 📚. Specifically, my
current research interests are on understanding the behavior of large language
models (LLMs), semi-parametric natural language methods based on external
corpora retrievers (such as augmented language models), autonomous knowledge
management using LLMs, and language model cascades (agent LLMs).
