I am a senior researcher at [NEC Corporation](https://www.nec.com/). I am now a
principal investigator of *knowledge-based learning team* of [Data Science
Research Laboratories](https://www.nec.com/en/global/rd/) at NEC Corporation. I
received my Ph.D. at [University of Tsukuba](https://www.tsukuba.ac.jp/en/) in
March 2018 under supervision of [Prof. Hiroyuki
Kitagawa](http://www.kde.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp/~kitagawa/index.html).

My research interests are on helping data analysis using <i class="fab fa-database"></i> data management technologies (DB) and <i class="fab fa-brain"></i> machine learning technologies (ML).
